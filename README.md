# Joke-mousemover
 Wait a random amount of time (60 to 360 minutes) and move the mouse, then quit

## Description
Wait a random amount of time (between 60 and 360 minutes) and then move the mouse randomly for 2 seconds.

## Requirements
Pip3 install pyautogui 	# https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/

## Executables:
These are pre-compiled exe fies which will run in background.  I have also included a non delay version to see that it does without waiting. 

<a href"https://github.com/lalliexperience/Joke-mousemover/blob/main/dist/mousemover.exe">mousemover.exe runs instantly</a>

<a href"https://github.com/lalliexperience/Joke-mousemover/blob/main/dist/mousemoverplusdelay.exe">mousemoverdelay.exe Waits a random amount of time (60 to 360 minutes before activating</a>



## Usage:
Rename to anything.exe if you want.  Run on target computer and walk way.  The program stops running after it moves the mouse.  You can loop this, but donâ€™t be a jerk.

## Other notes:
This script compiles quite large because of pyautogui.  If you know a better way to do it in python, please let me know.
